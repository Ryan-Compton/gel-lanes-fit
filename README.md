# Gel Lanes Fit

This plugin for ImageJ provides some functionality to set uo and perform quatitative analysys of gel electrophoresis images.
The plugin can be helpful in drawing same-size or custom ROIs (regions of interest).
The areas selected by the ROIs correspond to respective line profiles, obtained by averaging pixel intensities along horizontal lines in the ROI.
Gaussian peaks can be fitted to the line profiles. A polynomial function can be used to represent the background signal.
