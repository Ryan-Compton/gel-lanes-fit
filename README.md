# Gel Lanes Fit

This plugin for ImageJ provides some functionality to set up and perform quatitative analysys of gel electrophoresis images.
The plugin can draw same-size or custom ROIs (regions of interest).
The areas selected by the ROIs are used to compute respective line profiles for each gel lane. The profiles obtained by averaging pixel intensities along horizontal lines in the ROI.
Gaussian peaks can be fitted to the line profiles. A polynomial function can be used to represent the background signal in each profile.
